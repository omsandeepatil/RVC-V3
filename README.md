Breaking news from the tech rebellion front: Google has slapped an official ban on the RVC repository, claiming it's causing more ruckus than a toddler in a candy store.

Armed with the mighty Easy 10/25 and a sprinkle of basic commands, I'm on a mission to unban RVC and unleash the power of custom models for all, because who needs restrictions when you can have fun with AI?
